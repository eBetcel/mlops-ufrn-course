## A summary by Emanuel Betcel

<p>The paper begins bringning the idea that AI is already causing disruptive changes in some areas, making them more productive and lucrative.</p>
<p>Also, besides the top use of cases of AI are service operation optimization, product enhancement, supply chain management and manufacturing, one of the prime reasons for such high gains is adherence to the core and advanced best practices already rooted in software engineering (SE). This is because when AI products are being build, engineers need to  use design thinkingm internal testing, verification and validation before deployment, reusability and lifecycle approach, etc. That's why, while SE is already helping AI, the same is true in reverse.</p>
<p>AI can play a part in a SE project since the early stages. For the planning, AI can help find the most critical issues and build a priority list, help agile project management refining backlog and managing risks. For the requirements stage, AI can assist with recommendation for task allocation, making people development better and allowing the knowledge to be distruibuted more evenly. For the design stage, it's possible to use AI to identify and recognize desing patters through source code and user interface. The possibilities are almost unlimited.</p>
<p>Therefore, while humans may be daunted by the configuration options available in a system, automatic AI agents can find valuable arrangements. So, it's very reasonably saying that AI tools can be very useful weapons for Software Engineers.</p>
